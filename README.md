# 👋 Hi, I’m Thea
@cup-of-thea

## A little piece of me in tech

👀 I’m a woman engineer interested in C#, PHP and Rust, and I wish to join strong and kind communities

🌱 I've been working for 7 years in PHP/Symfony/Laravel in web companies and tech companies in France

❤️ I'm currently employed in a .NET environment since a couple of months

💞️ I’m looking to start collaborating in open-source (PHP/Rust or else)

📫 The best is to reach me [here](https://bento.me/thea) 😉

## Experience

- **Lead Developer** 🛩 Started a new job in Aircraft Sector since september 2022
- **Lead Developer** 🚗 2 years in French Automotive Data Engineering
- **Developer** 🖥 6 years in a web agency
- **Freelance** ❤️ 6 years freelancing in parallel

## What I want

I mostly want to join open-minded communities (🏳️‍⚧️ 🏳️‍🌈) and nice places and people to work with.
I fancy back-end, data-engineering and going out to tech conventions meeting people (😊) and advocating in things I trust.
I prefer working with concepts and people rather than tools or languages, however, I have preferences like :
